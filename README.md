## Cardinal Health Munki Repository

### Main Contact
Edward Shorrock is the current lead for all Mac DevOps at Cardinal Health.

### General Overview
#### What Munki Does:
Munki is a set of client side tools written in Python which allow us to manage the software on our Macs here at Cardinal Health. Munki was created by Walt Disney Animation Studios and is maintained by the general open source community.

Munki gives us the ability to install just about any piece of Mac software that is out there. It supports most major package formats. Although Munki does have other management features built into it we only take advantage of its ability to install and un-install software packages. This is what it was originally designed to do and it is arguably the best piece of software in the world and this task for Mac computers.

#### What Munki Does Not Do:
Munki is just about software deployment. It does not do any other management, imaging, inventory etc. We will use other tools for that.

### Munki Server Side Structure
In general Munki can be run on any modern web server. There are three major parts of Munki that reside on the server and these have their own folders in the root of the repository and are easy to find.
